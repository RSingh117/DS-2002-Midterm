# DS-2002-Midterm

This repository contains the ETL work I did for Data Project 1 alongside the source data that I utilized. The project was done using the classicmodels MySQL database, with the Customers table converted into a JSON file and the Products table converted into a CSV file. The Date dimension was integrated through a SQL file and the code required to run the project is contained within the Midterm Juypter Notebook file.
